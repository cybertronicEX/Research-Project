        -create a branch from dev branch for your components and work on them.  
        
        -commit your changes to your branch and put a  merge request to merge them with dev branch.
        
        -prior to merging with dev branch do a pull request from dev branch and merge locally to avoid merge conflicts.
        
        -only then it would be merged to main  branch.
